# Azure Notes

## Cloud concepts 

- Availability 
  - what percentage of time does a system respond properly to requests, expressed as a percentage over time
  - I.e. 99.99% availability implies up to 4 minutes per month of acceptable downtime

- High Availability
  - a system specifically designed to be resilient when some component of the system fails
  - Scale your application with Load balancers. supports both inbound and outbound, low latency 
  
- Scalability
  - the ability of a system to grow it’s capacity “easily” when a system reaches its maximum capacity
  - Scalability applies to
    - Disk I/O
	- CPU
	- Memory
	- Network I/O
 - Horizontal Scaling
   - Complex
   - Add more services and spread the load 
   - must sync the applications and data
   - Long term
 - Vertical Scaling 
   - Easier 
   - Adding more resources (like memory, disk and cpu)
   - Short term
 - VM Scale Sets in Azure
   - Create and Manage groups of identical, load balanced VM's 
   - Allows to centrally manage, configure and update large number of VM's 

- Elasticity 
  - the ability of a system to automatically grow when maximum capacity is reached, and automatically shrink to minimize waste
  - Ability to scale up and down
  - Handle high volume 
  - Use resources only when needed.
  - Avoids over provisioning and under provisioning 
  - Auto-scaling in Azure 
    - Add or remove VM's based on set of rules
	

- Agility
  - the ability to respond to change “rapidly” based on changes to market or environment
  - Value = Agility + Utilization 
  - Ability to provision and de-provision nearly unlimited resources as needed with complete control
  - Projects can be provisioned and deployed within 24 hours 
  
- Fault Tolerance 
  - the ability to tolerate hardware failures in your system, required to achieve high availability
  - Ability to continue providing services even after the failure of one or more cloud components  
  - Availability Sets in Azure 
  
- Disaster Recovery 
  - - the ability to recover from a big failure within an acceptable period of time, with an acceptable amount of data lost
  - Types 
    - Completely Unavailable 
    - Partially available 
	- Fully available
  - Azure site recovery service 
    - Replicates workloads to a secondary location
	- it outage in primary site, fails over to secondary. once the outage is over fall back to primary. 
	
- Economies of Scale
  - the more you buy something, the cheaper it is per unit to buy; and the cheaper it is to maintain
  - Microsoft (and Google and AWS) can buy and run a server cheaper that you could ever possibly do yourself
  - Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale	
	
- CapEX vs OpEx
  - Capital Expenditures 
    - a (usually large) amount of money invested in an asset (building, computers, equipment) spent up front, and it returns back profits slowly over time
	- major cash drain or loan required
	- cannot be deducted from your taxes in one year
	- depreciated over several years
    - Money company spends on fixed assets
	- knows as PP&E - Property, Plant and Equipment 
	- One time purchases 
	- Servers, network devices, printers, scanners
	- Depreciation 
  - Operating Expenditures
    - an amount of money spent “every month” as an operating expense
	- hopefully you earn more money in revenue from it than you spend
	- can be deducted from your taxes immediately
	- many accountants prefer OpEx over CapEx for the tax and cash flow benefits
    - Funds used to run day to day business 	
	- generally used up with in the year they purchased
	- printer cartridges, paper, electricity 
	- Web site hosting, web domain registrations, maintenance agreement, yearly service 
	- Pay as you go items 
	
- Consumption-Based Model 
  - paying for something based on how much you used, as opposed to paying for something no matter if you use it or not.
  - I.e. A monthly gym membership is a fixed-price model, you pay the same every month. 
  - But if you only paid when you actually went to the gym (like an entry fee), that would be a consumption model
  - Most cloud services charge only when you use the thing, not a fixed-price per month.
	
- IAAS 
  - Provides infrastructure required on demand 
  - this is the computing paradigm where Azure provides you the virtual hardware (Virtual machine, load balancer, virtual network), 
  - you can have complete control over that. 
  - It replicates the exact function of equipment that you’d have in your own data center (like a server, firewall, router, etc)
  - IaaS Examples: Virtual machine, load balancer, application gateway, virtual network
  - This service offering helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other data center infrastructure.
  - IAAS scenarios 
    - Test and Development 
    - Website hosting 
	- Storage, backup and recovery 
	- Web applications
	- High performance computing (eg : weather predictions, financial modeling)
	- Big data analysis 
  - Advantages 
	- Eliminates CapEx and reduces ongoing cost 
	- improves business continuity and DR 
	- Innovate rapidly 
	- Focus on core business
	- increase stability 
	- No need to troubleshoot equipment problems. cloud provides takes the responsibility of infra resources 
	- Get new applications to user faster 
  - When to use IAAS 
    - Startup or small company 
	- Large organization looking to only purchase what is needed
	- rapidly growing companies 
	- When you not sure of the demand
	- Google Compute Engine 
  - Responsibilities 
    - User
	  - Purchase, installation, configuration, and management of their own software operating systems, middleware, and applications.
	- Cloud Provider
	  - Responsible for ensuring that the underlying cloud infrastructure (such as virtual machines, storage, and networking) is available for the user.

- PAAS 	
  - Complete development and deployment environment in cloud 
  - you lose some control over the hardware; generally, you upload your code and just configure the environment in Azure to run it
  - PaaS Examples: App Services, Web Apps
  - purchase resources when you need 
  - Includes IAAS (Services, Storage & networking)
  - also includes middle-ware, development tools and business intelligence 
  - Designed to support complete cycle of web apps
  - Avoid expenses of buying / Managing software licenses 
  - you manage the application and services 
  - PAAS scenarios  
    - Development framework

	- provides inbuilt tools
	- Develop for multiple platforms (mobile)
	- Pay as you go 
	- efficiently manage application life cycle 
	- Geographically distributed 
  - When to use PASS
    - Multiple developers working on same project 
	- own customized applications 
	- if you rapidly developing and deploying application
  - Examples 
	- AWS ELastic Bean Stalk 
	- Google app Engine 
	- windows Azure 
  - Responsibilities 
    - User
	  - Responsible for the development of their own applications.
	- Cloud Provider
	  - Responsible for operating system management, and network and service configuration.

- SAAS 
  - Connects to cloud based apps over Internet
  - you lose even more control over the hardware and the software
  - generally, Azure provides you an application that they developed and you just configure it to your usage. You are a tenant using their software.
  - SaaS also provides infrastructure as a service.
  - Email, Office 365
  - COmplete softwARE Solution 
  - Pay as you go
  - service provider manages software and hardware 
  - SAAS scenarios 
    - Outlook
	- Yahoo mail
	- Gmail 
	- EMail, Calender, Scheduling 
	- CRM 
	- ERP 
  - Advantages
    - pay only what you use 
	- no need to worry of hardware or software 
	- free client software (browser)
	- Access app data from anywhere 
  - When to use SAAS
    - short term projects requires collaboration 
	- applications need both web and mobile access 
  - Example 
    - Google Apps
	- Cisco Webex 
	- Drop box 
	- Concur 
	- GotoMeeting
  - Responsibilities 
    - User
	  - Users just use the application software; they are not responsible for any maintenance or management of that software.
	- Cloud Provider
	  - The cloud provider is responsible for the provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.
	

- Public Cloud	
  - Cloud services provided over the public Internet to anyone who wants to sign up for them
  - Public Internet 
  - Shared with other tenants 
  - Low cost 
  - No maintenance
  - near unlimited scalability
  - high reliability 
  
- Private Cloud 
  - Cloud services offered only to select users. This is sometimes called an “internal cloud”. 
  - Looks and acts like a cloud computing, but uses resources and servers available only to your company/organization
  - Exclusively for one business or organization
  - located at organization's on-site data center or hosted by third party service provider  
  - Private network 
  - customize resources  for own requirements
  - more flexibility
  - more security 
  - Resources are not shared with others 
  - higher level of control and security 
  - high efficiency and low latency 
  
- Hybrid Cloud 
  - A mixture between your own private networks and servers, and using the public cloud for some things. 
  - Typically used to take advantage of the unlimited, inexpensive growth benefits of the public cloud
  - The best of both worlds
  - Combine on-premises infrastructure (or) private clouds with public clouds 
  - Organization can host sensitive data in private cloud and public data in public cloud 
  - Data and apps can move between private and public clouds 
  - Cloud bursting 
    - When spike in demand occurs, organization can burst to public cloud and tap into additional computing resources 
	- Example: Tax software
  - Control 
  - Flexibility 
  - cost effective 
  - Ease
	
## Core Azure Services

- Geography 
  - Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa
  - 2 or more regions 

- Regions
  - 54 regions around the world.  12 are in plan 
  - e.g. North Europe, West Europe, Germany North, Germany West Central
  - independent power, cooling, and networking

- Paired Regions 
  - Each region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away
  - allows for the replication of resources
  - For platform updates (Planned maintenance) only one paired region will be updated at a time
  - to avoid outage 

- Availability Zones 
  - for HA 
  - e.g. Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 
  - physical locations within azure region 
  - minimum 3 separate zones in all enabled regions 
  - 99.99 % VM uptime SLA

- Availability Sets
  - Availability Sets comprise of update and fault domains 
  - Update Domain 
    - When a maintenance event occurs, the update is sequenced through update domains
  - Fault Domain
    - Fault domains provide for the physical separation of a workload across different hardware in the data center. 

- Hierarchy
  - Geography > Region > Availability Zone > Availability Set > Fault Domain/Update Domain 
  
- Resource Groups  
  - Group the related resources by project or feature (container)
  - all resources should share the same life cycle 
  - one resource can be in one resource group 
  - Can move, add, remove at any time
  - can group from different regions 
  - scope access control (permissions, billings)
  - resources one resource group can interact another resources in another resource group. 
  - location required when creating resource group (this saved in metadata)
  
- Azure Resource Manager
  - deploy, update, delete, monitor all the resources as a group
  - security, auditing, tagging 
  - Resource 
  - Resource Group

  - like EC2
  - looks, acts, feels, tastes like a real server in front of you.
  - except it’s running inside Azure’s data center in a virtualized environment
  - Azure supports Windows and Linux virtual machines, with dozens of varieties of each
  - IaaS
  - still you need to maintain the VM (patching etc)
  - VM naming
  - location 
  - Size of the VM - process, cpu
  - Number of VM's needed
  - OS
  - configuration after it starts
  - related resources (virtual network etc)
  - name can be up to 15 chars 
  - computer name (as part of OS) and vm name is same if you use Azure vm 
  - if you use your own image, name can be different. best practice to keep the same name 
  - VM Scale Sets 
	  - create and manage group of identical, load balanced VM'same
	  - Number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease
	  - provide HA 
	  - offers auto scaling and load balance
	  
- Hypervisor
  - a layer that runs on top of the physical server Operating System that allows multiple guest operating systems (virtual machines) to run in an isolated manner on top

- Virtual Machine Scale Sets 
  - these are a set of identical virtual machines (from 1 to 1000 instances) that are designed to auto-scale up and down based on user demand
  - IaaS
  
- Azure App Service 
  - like Elastic Beanstalk
  - allows you to upload your code and configuration into Azure, and Azure will run the application as you specify
  - lots of integrations with Visual Studio, and other features and benefits provided on this platform
  - PaaS
  - build and host web apps, mobile restful api's 
  - auto scaling and HA
  - supports both windows and Linux
  - enables automated deployments (from Github etc)
  - Java,.Net, ruby, python etc 
  - SAAS in mins

- Azure Container Instances (ACI) 
  - the quickest way to create a container on Azure. 
  - You can deploy an image to Azure in about a minute. 
  - It can be used in production, 
  - but is not easily scalable.
  
- Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) 
  - Kubernetes containers in Azure. 
  - Runs on Virtual Machine Scale Sets. 
  - Has auto-scaling, but also requires more overhead to run
  
## Networking

- Azure Virtual Networks 
  - a representation of a real network
  - all virtual machines must be connected to a virtual network subnet, and this allows them to talk to each other and to the Internet as long as it follows the rules of the network that you define
  - Enables resources to securely communicate with each others
  - Internet or on perm networks 
  - scoped to single region 
  - can interact to different regions using V-Net peering   
  - isolation 
  - by default outbound to Internet 
  - filter network traffic using security group or network appliance 
  - route network traffic (route tables)
  - connect other virtual networks (can be in same or other regions) using V-Net peering  
  
- Azure Load balancer
  - sometimes called a level-4 load balancer
  - allows you to improve performance by splitting work among two or more identical machines
  - allows for horizontal scaling of application performance by adding more servers
  - IaaS
  - Scaling and HA 
  - supports inbound and outbound connections
  - low latency and high throughput
  - two SKU's 
    - Basic 
    - Standard 
  - Port forwarding traffic to specific port
  - Application agnostic 
  - Automatic reconfiguration 
  - health probes (health check)
  - Public load balancer - Maps the public ip address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP and port of the VM and vice versa 
  - Internal Load balancer - directs the traffic only to resources that are inside virtual network or that uses vpn to access azure infra
  
- VPN Gateway 
  - a device that allows encrypted private communication between a single computer or a network of servers, and an Azure network
  
- IaaS Application Gateway 
  - sometimes called a level-7 load balancer
  - a type of load balancer that operates at the application level and can understand HTTP syntax
  - it can make load balancing decisions off of a domain name, or part of a URL path
  - IaaS

- Content Delivery Network 
  - allows you to improve performance by removing the burden of serving static, unchanging files from the main server to a network of servers around the globe;
  - a CDN can reduce traffic to a server by 50% or more, which means you can serve more users or serve the same users faster

## Storage 

- Azure Storage 
  - a cheap place to store files, along with basic table and queue features
  - pay per Gigabyte
  - IaaS 
  
- Managed Disk 
  - slightly more expensive, but this will allow Azure to provide some additional features that reduce the burden of managing your own storage account
  - pay per month for a provided GB limit

- IaaS Backup and Recovery Storage

## Tips 

- Azure Cloud Shell for Android OS
- Azure in public preview comes as is.  No SLA
- Azure provides separate portal for previews  
- if the tag is assigned at resource group, it will not be inherited to resources  
- Azure locks are used to prevent accidental modification or deletion of resources 
- Azure app service is Serverless
- IOT Hub - Monitor and Control millions of IOT Assests - 
- IOT Edge - to analyze data on the device. means at the edge instead of the cloud
